
 MapReduce Project in Python is our end semester project in CS604- Advanced Opersating Systems

This project simulates the MapReduce programming model using Python. It demonstrates a simple word count application by dividing the process into three main stages:

- Map: Reads an input file line-by-line, splits each line into words, and emits intermediate key-value pairs (i.e., each word paired with the number 1).
- Shuffle and Sort: Sorts the intermediate output from the mapper to simulate the grouping of similar keys (words).
- Reduce: Aggregates the counts for each word from the sorted mapper output.

The project is designed for cross-platform compatibility (with specific adjustments for Windows) and includes a script to generate a sample input file with 100 lines of text.

 Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A terminal/command prompt (the project includes Windows-friendly code).

 Getting Started

 1. Generate the Input File

Use the `generate_input.py` script to create an input file containing 100 randomly generated lines.

bash
python generate_input.py


This command creates (or updates) the file `input/sample.txt` in the project folder.

 2. Run the MapReduce Pipeline

Execute the driver script to run the entire MapReduce simulation:

bash
python driver.py


What Happens:

- Step 1: The `driver.py` script reads `input/sample.txt` and feeds it to the mapper, saving the output in `mapped.txt`.
- Step 2: It then sorts the contents of `mapped.txt` (simulating the shuffle and sort phase in MapReduce) and writes the sorted data to `sorted.txt`.
- Step 3: Finally, the sorted output is fed into the reducer, and the final aggregated word counts are written to `output.txt`.

 3. View the Results

After running `driver.py`, open the `output.txt` file to review the aggregated word counts.

 Component Details

 generate_input.py

- Purpose: Generates a 100-line input file with random sentences.
- Key Points:  
  - Creates an `input/` directory if it doesnt exist.
  - Randomly selects words from a predetermined list (e.g., "hello", "world", "mapreduce", etc.) to form sentences.
  
 mapper.py

- Purpose: Processes each line from the input file, splits the line into words, and prints each word with a count of 1 (formatted as `word<TAB>1`).
- Key Points:  
  - Uses standard input (`sys.stdin`) for flexibility.
  
 reducer.py

- Purpose: Reads sorted key-value pairs, aggregates the counts for each unique word, and prints the total count.
- Key Points:  
  - Assumes the mapper output is sorted by the word.
  - Maintains a running total for each word until a new word is encountered.

 driver.py

- Purpose: Coordinates the execution of the MapReduce workflow.
- Key Points:  
  - Uses Pythons `subprocess` module to pipe data between the mapper and reducer.
  - Sorts intermediate mapper output within Python, ensuring compatibility with Windows (avoiding Unix commands like `cat` and `sort`).

 Future Enhancements

- Parallel Processing: Leverage Pythons `multiprocessing` or `threading` modules to parallelize the mapper phase.
- Dynamic Input Handling: Expand the system to process different types of input files or larger datasets.
- Improved Error Handling: Incorporate robust logging and error-handling to catch and manage runtime exceptions.
- Object-Oriented Design: Refactor the code into classes for increased modularity and scalability.
