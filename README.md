# MapReduce
MapReduce Simulation in Python: This project demonstrates a simple MapReduce framework implemented in Python for educational purposes. It simulates a word count job using a mapper to emit key-value pairs from 100 generated input lines and a reducer to aggregate counts. A driver script coordinates the process and produces final results check output.
